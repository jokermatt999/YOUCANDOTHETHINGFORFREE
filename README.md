# YOUCANDOTHETHINGFORFREE
oh hey, cool a list of stuff to google that needs way more editing but oops here's a free toolbox to make art n stuff, k? don't take it too serious, don't judge, esp. lil baby stuff, or too harsh, it'll get better in time. this might be for kids? ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
###
list of stuff in quotes to google, and make a kit to do the thing for free, because YOU CAN DO THE THING and art :) bill wurtz is fun and inspiring.
>"open source" software is free, but imo very valuable to know about.

>"Audacity" lets you record and mix audio.

>"OpenShot" is a free video editor i taught myself to use on a whim last month by searching "open source video editor", maybe it was 'free' or i added 'windows' idk, but I can make 10 second videos now. i think you can, so i wanted to advise maybe how or something

that's uh...ok that's just kinda 2 or 3 programs. I intended a longer list here. umm just use mspaint or whatever and doodle and share, because this cool guy showed us it works out pretty awesome and it's fun. He may even make a living from this? I don't understand him fully either, but he's great.

cool still here? lightning round of *free* stuff to search and learn about, k?
"Kevin MacLeod" does a lot of free soundtrack stuff a lot of people use. cool guy, emailed me back when i rambled hey thanks at him via email, but also just whoa everywhere
"Blender" did you think you could 3d model? me either but that happened in january, cool.
"Unity" yup you can maybe make games btw. blender plugs right in. didn't know until i tried it!
"GNU Image Manipulation Program" uh sorta free photoshop? idk photoshop but i can make multilayer images. more powerful than mspaint! but also yeah gotta learn it because it can do a lot. good wiki/help tho
"VLC Media Player" just how a video player should act, easy. 
"everything voidtools" really good search because windows isn't and ugh folders. personal preference probably, idk. quicker?
"notepad++" notepad but it saves what you're doing w/o you needing to think, also it has tabs. '++' is a programming joke; it translates roughly to 'add one to that thing before ++'.

"FREE CODE CAMP"
LEARN TO PROGRAM IF YOU REALLY WANT TO MAKE ANYTHING. ok I learned that from actual school first so idk how that part'll go. the rest of that stuff is filled in by searching, reading, and learning until i got it.

That's the weird collection of stuff I taught myself about for free over the internet that makes it so i can make things. tho im still mostly tryna be a person first bc i also was sick on bedrest for like, a while. since i've just done a lot of lil things for friends or saved in .txts stashed on my computer so far, k? but...hey i made a thing. it should've been (be?) edited more coherently. i'll go sleep now.
